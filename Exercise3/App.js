//Practice what you learned about components and build a new React component on your own!
//Your task is to build a custom <ExerciseComponent /> that outputs the text "First exercise - done!" on the screen.
//Use the empty ExerciseComponent.js file for your new component code and output this component inside the already 
//existing App component thereafter (replace the existing JSX code in App with your own component).
